This is a very simple blockchain implementation, in the scope of a semester project of the
"Distributed Systems" course of the School of ECE of the NTUA.

The consensus protocol is proof of stake. The network has fixed capacity and is set up
by a bootstrap node. Every node in the network participates in the protocol. The nodes
can send messages, coins or both to each other.

It has not been tested against evil nodes.
